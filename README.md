# Titanic Data Analysis

A comrehensive data analysis on the Titanic Dataset.
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In the analysis of the Titanic dataset, the major question that arises is How many factors affected a person's survival rate? With the given data, this question was broken down into further branches. A) Did individual characteristics played any role in the survival rate?

Age
Gender
Adult or child
Passenger Class B) Which was the location a passenger embarked from? And is there a relation between the embarkment location and the class in which the passenger resided? Perhaps that may tell us something about that place's socio economic condition. C) Did the survival rate depend on whether the person was travelling alone or with family? If with family, these were the factors: 1. Sibling 2. Parents

I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and provided various visualisations.I have also handled missing values.

Then I splited the data into training and testing sets.I have used Five Supervised Learning Algorithms : 
    1.Logistic Regression
    2.K Nearest Neighbour
    3.Gaussian Naive Bayes
    4.Decision Tree
    5.Support Vector Machines

Decision Tree Classifier Performed efficiently with 100% Accuracy.
